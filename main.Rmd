  The aim of this project is to investigate the the approximate message passing algorithm for SLOPE regularization problem based on [@bu2019algorithmic] and compare it with classical convex optimization methods.
  Some numerical experiments regarding the cases that do not fit into the theoretical framework of [@bu2019algorithmic] are also performed and analyzed.

## Theoretical bacground
### Introduction
We are interested in solving the standard linear inverse problem
$$ y = Ax + w, $$
where $y\in \R^n$ is  and $A\in\R^{n\times p}$ are known parameters of the model, $w\in\R^n$ is a random noise vector and $x\in\R^p$ is an unknown vector of paramteres we wish to estimate. 

The problem

### SLOPE

Regulizing function is of the form.
